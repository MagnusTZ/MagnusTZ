### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**MagnusTZ/MagnusTZ** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

As a dedicated Astrophysics major and Computer Engineering minor, I have a passion for both scientific research and app development. With a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, HTML & CSS, and JavaScript, I have honed my skills in cross platform development using Flutter and Google's Firebase. I utilize tools like Slack for effective communication and Jira for project management to deliver high-quality software solutions.

My drive for both scientific exploration and innovation in technology has driven me to pursue a career at the intersection of these two fields. I am eager to bring my skills and passion to a dynamic work environment where I can continue to grow and contribute to cutting-edge projects.

Outside of the classroom, I have participated in various hackathons and software development projects that have allowed me to apply my skills in a real-world setting. I am always looking for new opportunities to challenge myself and expand my knowledge base.

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects and initiatives at the intersection of Astrophysics and Software Engineering.
